# ML-fake-review-detection
Hybrid Fake Review Detection using LSTM &amp; BERT

This project builds a **hybrid deep learning model** to detect fake reviews using a combination of **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**.

The model is trained to identify whether a review is genuine or fake, using techniques such as text preprocessing, embedding with BERT, and sequential classification with LSTM.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed text data (removal of HTML tags, special characters, stop words, etc.)
- ðŸ§  Used **BERT tokenizer and embeddings** for word representation
- ðŸ”„ Built an **LSTM-based neural network** for classification
- ðŸ“Š Evaluated model performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
- ðŸ“ˆ Visualized training/validation loss and accuracy over epochs
